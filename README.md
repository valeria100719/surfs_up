## Discussion

The lowest temperature recorded in December was around 56 degrees.This temperature might seem cold to the local population but for some tourists it might be a perfect spring weather to eat ice cream. 
The best idea might be to repeat the analysis and to consider all months between December and June. This could give a better understanding of the average temperature. It could also help to understand when temperatures were recorded during the day (morning, afternoon or night). It is easy to imagine that temperatures at 12pm are different from temperatures taken at 6am or 6pm.
Unfortunately, this analysis is missing from our first study, and it could be a crucial factor in determining if the venue is suitable for an ice cream business.
